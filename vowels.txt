This book has a lot to say about ancient greek perspectives and their meaning
but there is one perspective it misses. That is their view of time. They saw
the future as something that came upon them from behind their backs with the
past receding away before their eyes. When you think about it, that's a more
accurate metaphor than our present one. Who really can face the future? All
you can do is project from the past, even when the past shows that such
projections are often wrong. And who really can forget the past? What else is
there to know? Ten years after the publication of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance the Ancient Greek perspective is certainly appropriate. What sort
of future is coming up from behind I don't really know. But the past, spread out
ahead, dominates everything in sight. Certainly no one could have predicted what
has happened. Back then, after 121 others had turned this book down, one lone
editor offered a standard $3,000 advance. He said the book forced him to decide
what he was in publishing for, and added that although this was almost certainly
the last payment, I shouldn't be discouraged. Money wasn't the point with a book
like this. That was true. But then came publication day, astonishing reviews,
best-seller status, magazine interviews, radio and TV interviews, movie offers,
foreign publications, endless offers to speak, and fan mail, week after week,
month after month. The letters have been full of questions: Why? How did this
happen?
